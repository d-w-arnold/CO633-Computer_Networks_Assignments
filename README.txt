Quick-start instructions for testing your implementations
of sendMessage/receiveMessage

Running under BlueJ:

- Load this project.

- To test sendMessage/sendReceiver, right click on the
  corresponding test class and invoke method runTest().

  object first.

- Enter test messages/frames in the BlueJ terminal window.
  Type a single dot (.) to stop the test.

- See documentation for class TestSender/TestReceiver for
  further info (or see comments at start of source file).
